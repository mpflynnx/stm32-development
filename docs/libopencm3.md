The `libopencm3` project aims to create an open-source firmware library for various ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers.

### Installation on Ubuntu based distros

libopencm3 needs compiling once for the project to use it, therefore an `arm-none-eabi/arm-elf` toolchain is required:

```bash
$ sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
```
